AEMET-OpenData is a Python module implementing an interface to the AEMET OpenData Rest API.  
It allows a user to gather all the public weather information from AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog√≠a).

Documentation for the AEMET OpenData Rest API is available at https://opendata.aemet.es/.

This package has been developed to be used with https://home-assistant.io/ but it can be used in other contexts.
